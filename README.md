</p>

Repository of architectures for Large Language Models (LLMs), along with algorithms for
data collection, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation and distillation.

All algorithms are implemented from scratch in PyTorch. Hence it serves as an excellent reference
for students, ML engineers and ML practitioners alike. This repository is inspired by the
minGPT (https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) series, and adds on top by following industry best practices
like clean and well documented code, modular and well tested components, following standard PyTorch APIs
like Datasets and DataLoaders. The repository also aims to expand beyond pretraining, and include other algorithms too
like LoRA finetuning, distillation and RLHF alignment.
