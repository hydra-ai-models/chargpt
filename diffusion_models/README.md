## Getting started

### Setting up the dev environment for diffusion models.

Clone this repository and navigate to the `diffusion_models` directory.

#### On Mac
We will be using conda virtual environments for development. If you have not used conda before, install it first following instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/metal/pytorch/). Now create a conda environment and activate it. Sample commands to run in the terminal are
`conda create --name diffusion_models_from_scratch_env python=3.9`

`conda activate diffusion_models_from_scratch_env`

Now install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setting up the Hugging Face token.
We will be using Hugging Face datasets for training. To access these datasets, you have to be a registered user in ü§ó Hugging Face Hub, and you'll also need to use an access token for the code to work. For more information on access tokens, please refer to the [ü§ó Hugging Face documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens).

Run the following command to authenticate your token
`huggingface-cli login`

### Running the trainer scripts
To train the image diffusion model, run the python script `trainer_diffusion_model.py` using `python -m trainer.trainer_diffusion_model`, or run the Jupyter notebook `trainer_diffusion_model.ipynb`.
